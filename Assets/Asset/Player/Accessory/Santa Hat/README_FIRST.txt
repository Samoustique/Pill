Santa Hat

3D model of a santa headwear, or Christmas hat, traditionally worn by "Santa Clause" in folklore, and contemporary costumes.  This model consists of 47,344 polygons and 47,346 vertices. The object has been UV Unwrapped in its subdivided state, and comes complete with all the PBR (physically based rendering) maps to help create a photo-like rendering in your software of choice. The texture maps include a color, tangent normal, specular, bump, and special softness map, which can be used in various rendering engine materials or shaders to provide a satisfactory result.  Procedural maps can also be used in place of, or in addition to, the provided texture maps.  All of the example preview renders were done using the same exact texture maps provided with the model, using the Corona render engine in 3dsmax.

RENDERING TIPS:  Optimum render results will depend on the shaders and materials you use in your given render engine.  I recommend a vevet shader for use with the color and normal maps in the red material zone, and a soft, slightly translucent shader with SSS for the white material zone.  I've provided several additional texture maps which, when used together in certain channels of a PBR (physically based rendering) material shader, can help simulate the appropriate material surface for the hat.  For example, I recommend incorporating some "transmission" or SSS (subsurface scattering) on the white material zone of the hat, and have provided a softness map to assist in driving that effect, if you choose to use it.  You can also assign hair or fiber effects to either or both of the two material zones for even more realism, if your render engine and 3D software supports such effects.

You are free to use or modify this model as you see fit, for your own rendering projects or scenes. As with all my freebies, the object can be used for both commercial and non-commercial renders. You may NOT, however, resell or redistribute the model or textures, or any derivative of them; individually, or as part of a package/set.

The 3dsmax file is compatible with 3dsmax 2012 or higher, and also includes the base, low-poly version of the hat (simply unhide ALL to reveal the low poly version).  The low poly model has not been UV unwrapped.

*** OBJ IMPORT INSTRUCTIONS: There are 3 different OBJ files associated with this model, and one MTL file, which defines the material definitions.  You will notice that two of the three OBJ files are labeled for use in specific software applications (Poser and Blender).  For best results, it's highly recommended that you import the correct file to the corresponding software application.

POSER USERS:  The OBJ with (POSER) suffix was exported with a scale conversion that will allow the object to load with appropriate scaling into Poser 9 and above, or Daz Studio 4 and above, with Poser import settings. To import this file into Poser, please BE SURE to DE-select all the check box options in the OBJ Import Options dialogue box. DESELECT the "Centered", "Place On Floor", "Percent of Standard Figure Size", etc. so that no options are checked.  This will import the object exactly as intended into the scene, with proper scaling.  DAZ STUDIO users: Select "File/Import", then navigate to the folder on your hard drive that contains the model in this pack.  Choose the "(POSER).obj".  In the Import Options dialogue box, pick the Poser (1unit=8ft) option in the "FROM" dropdown list.  Be sure all other options are checked, and click "Accept".  BLENDER USERS:  Select the "(BLENDER).obj".  All other software packages should import the standard "(STANDARD).obj".

Thanks,
John
